#This project uses the pygame module. The module can be downloaded here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
#The version I used is: pygame-1.9.2a0.win32-py2.7.msi
#To install the module, run the msi file, and import pygame in python.

#The project is a game named Jia's Monopoly. It is similar to a monopoly game.
#It allows three people to play together, and has lands, buildings, events, cards etc.
#To run the project, open the TP3.py file and run it. The game is based on the mouse. 
#If you click a button and it does not work, it can be because the button cannot be clicked too quickly.
#Try pressing the mouse for about a quarter of a second.
